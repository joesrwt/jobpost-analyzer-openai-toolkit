LinkedIn Job Post Analyzer & Mock Interview Toolkit

Overview

The LinkedIn Job Post Analyzer & Mock Interview Toolkit is a web application built with Streamlit that helps job seekers extract key insights from LinkedIn job postings and prepare for interviews. The tool utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to extract technical skills, soft skills, and company characteristics from a job description, as well as generate mock behavioral interview questions based on those insights.
